# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native where a FlatList component may appear empty even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue arises from improper handling of data updates or unexpected data structures returned from the API.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains empty, even though the API call succeeds.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the data structure received from the API and ensuring it's compatible with how the FlatList is configured.  Examine the `keyExtractor` and `renderItem` props, and check if the data being passed to the FlatList is correctly formatted.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights the importance of robust error handling and data validation when working with asynchronous operations and external APIs in React Native.
